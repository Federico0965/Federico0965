# How I actually start programming?
- I started programming at the age of 7 because I saw my Dad that he knew languages like C, C++, Quick Basic, and Python, then I asked him what is programming, then he told me it's telling a computer what to do, then I asked him to teach me how to code, then he introduced me to Python Programming, and when I started learning, the only things I learnt were `print`, and `input` statements. And I learned everything including variables.
- Now that I mastered everything related to Python, I decided to start a Python YouTube channel to share my knowledge of Python programming to people who are finding ways to learn how to code in Python. I'm making videos from the Beginner all the way to the Advanced level, if you want to code or want to learn how to code, SUBSCRIBE TO ME NOW because I make easy-to-follow Python programming tutorials, and if you're stuck on any code, or have any questions, leave a comment below, I'll get back to you and help you out with your problems!
